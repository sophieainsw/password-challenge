# password-challenge

For this challenge I created an application that can be used to generate a random password. The password was created using criteria they user selected. 
I used the starter code provided and added to the javascript code to ensure the code worked properly.

The password is genereated when the button is clicked and the user is prompted to confirm if they would like to use any of the following criteria;
Lowercase
Uppercase
Numeric
Special characters ($@%&*, etc).
The password also had to contain at least 8 characters but no more than 128.
